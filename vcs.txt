CSS,JS,Images etc.VCS are the most commonly run as stand-alone applications, but revision control is also embedded in various types 
of softwares such as word processors and  spread sheets,collaborative and feature branches.The need for the logical way to organise
 and control revisions has existed for almost as long as writing has existed.
